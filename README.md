# Project Assignment Instructions

1. The ‘todos’ are going to be objects that be dynamically created, which means either using factories or constructors/classes to generate them.

2. Brainstorm what kind of properties the todo-items are going to have. At a minimum they should have a title, description and priority. Maybe  also include notes or even a checklist.

3. The todo list should have projects or separate lists of todos. When a user first opens the app, there should be some sort of ‘default’ project to which all of their todos are put. Users should be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into.(!!!!!!!!!)
